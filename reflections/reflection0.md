# Reflection 0
Overall, everyone on my team seems to work pretty well together! We have good communication and so far seem to be on the same page about everything.

## Written sprint reflection

### Individual and team goals
All of us noted interest in similar topics from the Google form on Day 1, specifically networking and OS. We talked about our experiences with these topics and with C, realizing that we all had very little experience with these concepts, but rather were interested and eager to learn.

### Responsibilities
Some of the first things we discussed after team formation included our individual motivation levels and amount of time we were planning on devoting to this class. Interestingly, we all said that SoftSys is the class we are most interested in this semester and thus are willing to put effort into making a good project, yet we do not want to devote all of our extra time to this class/we do not want to go overboard.

Next, we discussed administrative details: what things do we need to setup for this project. Once someone mentioned we need to decide on a scrum master, Daniel volunteered and we were all fine with that decision.

As discussed below, we have not yet reached the point of actual coding; we are still in the research phase. We are all researching in parallel, but once we begin coding, we will assign parts based on individual interests that have already been expressed.

### Moving forward
After the first day of class, we decided we should all read Ch 1 of HFC to introduce us to C and keep up with the class readings. We also decided to do come up with possible project ideas.

We met shortly after and decided on the most popular idea out of those that had been generated that also seemed within scope of the class and reasonable for our experience levels. Together, we researched what are the basic components needed to make our own version of bittorrent (what our project will be). From this preliminary research, we decided what chapters of HFC will be relevant to our project, so we added those to the sprint backlog. We also found some good other good resources online, such as articles talking about peer-to-peer networks and an example peer-to-peer chat room project, so we added reading and understanding those to the sprint backlog.

We want to have a solid understanding of what we are making before diving straight into the project, so we also added making a system diagram to the sprint backlog, which can be completed once we have all read more about our topic.

From our preliminary research that we conducted together, we agreed that a good starting point would be to look into peer-to-peer communication. Separately, we will also have to implement file transferring, but we will worry about this later, so it has been added to the project backlog. After both have been implemented, we will need to integrate the two.

So far, I am not too worried about our project; I think we know what steps we have to do and we have found multiple resources to help us along the way. My only apprehension is that making the jump from just reading about these topics to actually implementing them might be difficult; we might be spending a lot of time debugging, which could be difficult since we do not have a large network of computers.
